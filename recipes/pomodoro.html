    <h3>Pasta Pomodoro Is A Simple Pasta Dish With A Delicious Tomato Sauce, Fresh Basil, And Parmesan Cheese. This Quick And Easy Meal Is A Family Favorite And A Great Weeknight Dinner Recipe.</h3>
    <p>Pomodoro means tomato in Italian so its basically pasta with tomato sauce. It is a classic Italian dish that is made with simple ingredients…and that is a GOOD thing! Sometimes simple is best and that is SO true about this dish.</p>
  <h4>Ingredients</h4> 
  <ul>
    <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
    <li>1 medium yellow onion chopped</li>
    <li>5 garlic cloves  minced</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>1 28- ounce can San Marzano whole peeled tomatoes puréed in a food processor or blender</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/4 cup chopped basil</li>
    <li>12 ounces spaghetti</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter cut into pieces</li>
    <li>¼ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>Extra basil and Parmesan for garnish</li>
  </ul>

  
  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
<li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes or until the onion is soft. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook for 3 minutes. Stir in the puréed tomatoes and season with salt.</li>
    <li>Cook the sauce until it starts to thicken, stirring occasionally. This will take about 20 minutes. When the sauce has thickened, stir in the fresh basil.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta until al dente, according to package instructions. **Reserve ½ cup of the pasta water and then drain the pasta.**</li>
    <li>Place the pasta back in the large pot, add the tomato sauce and hot pasta water. Stir until the sauce coats the pasta. Add butter and Parmesan cheese and toss until butter and cheese are melted. Plate the pasta and garnish with basil and Parmesan cheese, if desired.</li>
</ol>
